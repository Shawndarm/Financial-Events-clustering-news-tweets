    "We extracted high-quality financial news by querying the `GDELT Project database` via **Google BigQuery**, specifically targeting reputable English-language sources. A randomized daily partitioning strategy was implemented to ensure 100% temporal density and continuity throughout the year **2023**. The newspaper3k library was then deployed to scrape full headlines and article bodies, automatically discarding low-quality or short entries. This process results in a robust, structured dataset optimized for the sentiment-based rolling window methodology."
